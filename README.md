### Playing NHL Game

## Starting the Game

To start the game, run the script GamePlayGUI.java. 

## Selecting Mode

You will be prompted with a screen to select the mode: Simple Goalie mode allows you to choose to use your glove or blocker to stop a scoring chance, Advanced goalie mode requires you to move across your net like a game of "pong" and Sim will simulate the season 1 game at a time. 

## Settings

Once you select a game mode, you will be taken to a screen where you will be able to enter the settings for the game. First, type your player name and hit enter to finalize it and make it turn red. Then you may click a number of games and the number will turn red. Next you can enter a number of games you would like to play rather rather than have simulated. This is best for if you want a realistic 82 game season, but don't want to play them all yourself. If this isn't working, make sure you have pressed enter after your name entry and that your name has turned red to allow you to move to this entry. Finally, you can choose between self selecting a team or going into the NHL Draft. Once all the values are red, you can hit enter to continue. If you are entering a team name make sure it is spelled correctly and then hit enter to confirm. If you go into the draft you have one opportunity to pass on a team by pressing 'z' to choose a new one.

## Playing Sim

During the regular season, you can see the year, your team, your name and position in the standings at the top of the screen. You can click on the right to enter the full standings page and then press enter to exit. You can press on the left side of the screen to simulate a game. For each game you set to "play" you will be taken to the summary screen and can press enter to return to the menu.
Once the playoffs begin, you will be able to check the playoff bracket and each press of play will play a single game in each series.

## Playing Simple Goalie

During the regular season, you can see the year, your team, your name and position in the standings at the top of the screen. You can click on the right to enter the full standings page and then press enter to exit. You can press on the left side of the screen to play a game.
When you enter a game you should follow the prompts on the screen to play along and select glove or blocker on each scoring attempt. You can track the score and time on the scoreboard and can speed up the game by holding ‘f’ or slow it down by holding ‘s’. When the game is over click back on the menu screen to return to the original GUI. DO NOT PRESS THE X IN THE RIGHT CORNER OR YOU WILL EXIT THE WHOLE GAME. Press enter on the summary screen to return to the main menu.
Once the playoffs begin, you will be able to check the playoff bracket and each press of play will play a single game in each series. If you have made the playoffs, you will be playing EVERY GAME until your team is eliminated or you win the Stanley Cup!

## Playing Advanced Goalie

During the regular season, you can see the year, your team, your name and position in the standings at the top of the screen. You can click on the right to enter the full standings page and then press enter to exit. You can press on the left side of the screen to play a game.
When you enter a game you should see the gameplay GUI pop up on the screen. your team is in BLUE and plays offense at the top of the screen. You are the goalie at the bottom of the screen. The game is not as simple as just moving your mouse around as you also have to select to use your glove, blocker, or cover the five-hole. Press g to use your glove and you are able to move your paddle over the left side of the net using your mouse. Press b and you are able to move your paddle over the right side of the net using your mouse. Press f and you will center your paddle to cover the five-hole. You can track the score and time on the side of the screen. During the time between play you can pull your goalie by pressing 'z' and this will give your team a greater chance to get the puck and shoot, but at the risk of leaving your net exposed. You can replace your goalie by pressing 'a' at a pause as well. To begin simulating the game, you can press 's'. When the game is over click back on the menu screen to return to the original GUI. DO NOT PRESS THE X IN THE RIGHT CORNER OR YOU WILL EXIT THE WHOLE GAME. Press enter on the summary screen to return to the main menu.
Once the playoffs begin, you will be able to check the playoff bracket and each press of play will play a single game in each series. If you have made the playoffs, you will be playing EVERY GAME until your team is eliminated or you win the Stanley Cup!

## Season End

Once the season is over, you will see the final playoff bracket and can press enter to go to the transition screen. At this point you can choose to play the next season with the same team or request a trade to play with a new team. You can also exit the GUI to end the game.

## Notes

Unfortunately, all boundary cases aren't accounted for. I made this game for fun, but wanted to share it here with you all. As a general note, just try not to do/type things that don't make sense otherwise you may cause something funky.

Additionally, you are unable to change the size of the popup window that the game is played in, because your actions depend on the absolute position where you click. That being said, you may move it around.
